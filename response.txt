I'd be happy to help you with your course.

You're looking for information on where and how much content is taught about forms and input tags in HTML in your Sigma Web Development course. From what I can see, it looks like this topic is covered in two videos: "Forms and input tags in HTML" (Video #7) and "Installing VS Code & How Websites Work" (Video #1).

In Video #7, the instructor starts discussing forms and input tags around 0 seconds into the video. They explain that a form action is equal to post and demonstrate how to use input tags in a form, including elements like dates, phone numbers, and text fields.

If you're looking for more information on this topic, I'd recommend checking out Video #7, which starts at 0.0 seconds and ends at approximately 4.88 seconds. This video provides a detailed explanation of forms and input tags in HTML, along with examples of how to use them in practice.

Alternatively, if you're looking for a more general overview of forms and input tags, you might want to check out Video #1 (Installing VS Code & How Websites Work). While it's not exclusively focused on this topic, the instructor does mention forms and websites briefly around 1502.24 seconds into the video.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!
