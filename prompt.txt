I am teaching web development in my sigma web development course. Hete are subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in second, end time in second, the text at that time:

[{"title":"Forms and input tags in HTML","number":"7","start":0.0,"end":4.88,"text":" In this video, we will know what are forms and what is the input tag in the form."},{"title":"Installing VS Code & How Websites Work","number":"1","start":1433.18,"end":1436.18,"text":" in this course"},{"title":"Installing VS Code & How Websites Work","number":"1","start":1502.24,"end":1505.24,"text":" in this course"},{"title":"Forms and input tags in HTML","number":"7","start":203.84,"end":233.8,"text":" So form action is equal to post, I have written here, now I can show some input tags in it, I will tell you what are input tags, what elements will come in your form, like you can put a date, you can put in the form, you can tell the name, you can tell the phone number, you can say what is your age, it can be just a number, you want to put such things in the form, so I want to tell you that the input tag is what you put in the form and there is a label tag which is the one which is used to give that input,"},{"title":"Your First HTML Website","number":"2","start":1345.44,"end":1346.44,"text":" In this course,"}]
---------------------------------
"where is form and input tag in form taught in this course"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer, you have to answer in a human way (don't mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video  (in which video and at what timestep) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
